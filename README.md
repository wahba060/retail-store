üéØ Unveiling Insights: Superstore Sales & Profit Optimization Dashboard üéØ
I'm excited to share an interactive Power BI dashboard I worked on during my internship with Uneeq Interns! This dashboard provides a deep dive into sales, profit, and product performance for a fictional US Superstore, helping uncover trends, challenges, and opportunities.
üîç Key Takeaways from the Dashboard:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Sales & Profit Overview:
The store generated a total of $2.3M in sales, with the highest sales segment reaching $1.16M.
The profit margin stands at 12.47%, with an average profit per product of $28.66.
However, 1,871 transactions resulted in negative profits, prompting further investigation into loss-making areas.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Top & Bottom Performing Regions:
New York City ($256K) and Los Angeles ($175K) lead in sales, followed by Seattle ($119K) and San Francisco ($112K).
The highest sales were recorded in California, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Washington, as seen on the map.
Identifying what drives success in these regions can help improve performance in lower-performing states.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Category & Sub-Category Analysis:
Technology dominates with $836K in sales, followed by Furniture ($742K) and Office Supplies ($719K).
Within sub-categories, Phones and Chairs were the top performers, generating around $330K each, whereas Binders and Tables had comparatively lower sales.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Segment Insights:
The Consumer segment contributed $1.16M in sales and $130K in profit, making it the most profitable.
Corporate ($710K sales, $90K profit) and Home Office ($430K sales, $60K profit) follow behind, highlighting potential areas for targeted marketing strategies.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Profitability by Shipping Method:
Standard Class shipping led in profit at $61K, followed by Second Class ($23K), First Class ($17K), and Same Day ($4K).
This suggests that certain shipping methods may be more cost-effective than others.
üí° What‚Äôs Next?
 These insights help businesses optimize pricing, marketing strategies, and operational costs to maximize profitability. By addressing high-loss transactions and improving underperforming segments, we can work towards better decision-making and sustainable growth.
